# Kerala_IOT_Challenge-
Foxlab Makerspace in association with GTech - Group of Technology Companies in Kerala is launching our prestigious program “Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. Kerala IoT Challenge is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation



# About Me
Hello friends! My name is SALIM UMER and Currently pursuing diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at government polytechnic college perinthalmanna. my area of interest is mainly on iot and cyber security. I used to do small projects using Arduino

# Experiment 1 : Hello World LED Blinking
A basic program similar to printing "Hello World" in any programming language. The aim is to blink an LED using Arduino Uno Board. Currently I am using tinkercad an online stimulator for doing the experiments.

Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board developed by Arduino.cc. It has several advantages over the conventional microcontrollers. It comes with a pre-tested software and hardware libraries and has its own integrated development environment (IDE). Also it is less expensive & beginner friendly.

Components Required
Arduino Uno Board
LED (Any Color) x 1 Nos
220 OHM Resistor X 1 Nos
Breadboard
Connecting wires
# Circuit Diagram

Code
```
#define LED 8
void setup()
{
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
}
